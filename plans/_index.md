# Implementation plans

Implementation plans for nao-viewer — each plan turns a settled part of a spec (see [specs/_index.md](../specs/_index.md)) into concrete, buildable steps. Plans are ordered by their date-time filename prefix (`YYYYMMDDHHmm_`).

## Plans

<!-- One row per plan, chronological by filename prefix. Keep the Status column in sync with each plan's `**Status:**` line. -->

| [202610091003_viewer-window.md](202610091003_viewer-window.md) | `ViewerState` (overlay, ghost, attribution, keys) and `run` on MuJoCo's passive viewer; window title via `load_world(name=...)` (implements [viewer.md](../specs/viewer.md)) | Done |
| [202610091018_viewer-api.md](202610091018_viewer-api.md) | `launch` and the `Viewer` handle, the viewer process and its loopback protocol, the `table` scene, live window test (implements [api.md](../specs/api.md)) | Done |
| [202610091043_viewer-config.md](202610091043_viewer-config.md) | `NaoViewerConfig` and the `NaoViewer` object with `launch()` as a method, replacing the `launch()` function (implements [config.md](../specs/config.md), [api.md](../specs/api.md)) | Done |
| [202610091130_check-model-and-cli.md](202610091130_check-model-and-cli.md) | `check_model.run` and its report, the `nao-viewer` command with `view` and `check-model` (implements [check_model.md](../specs/check_model.md), [cli.md](../specs/cli.md)) | Done |
| [202610091137_headless-viewer.md](202610091137_headless-viewer.md) | `headless` config field, headless sim with offscreen rendering (Mesa's EGL on Linux), `run_headless`, a real headless viewer in the fast tier (implements [config.md](../specs/config.md), [api.md](../specs/api.md), [viewer.md](../specs/viewer.md), [testing.md](../specs/testing.md)) | Done |
| [202610091243_live-tier-window-switch.md](202610091243_live-tier-window-switch.md) | `NAO_VIEWER_E2E_WINDOW` chooses headless (default) or windowed viewers for a live run, replacing the per-test parametrization (implements [testing.md](../specs/testing.md)) | Done |
| [202610091309_ci.md](202610091309_ci.md) | CI on GitHub's Linux runners: `check`, `fast-tier` (real headless viewer, GL required) and `e2e-nao-sim` (nao-sim's NAOqi 2.1 at a pinned commit, vendor files cached) (implements [ci.md](../specs/ci.md), [testing.md](../specs/testing.md)) | Done |
| [202610091335_ci-image-cache.md](202610091335_ci-image-cache.md) | The live job caches nao-sim's built images (`docker save`/`load`, keyed on the nao-sim pin) instead of Aldebaran's vendor files (implements [ci.md](../specs/ci.md)) | Done |
| [202610091402_ci-macos-and-window.md](202610091402_ci-macos-and-window.md) | The fast tier on Linux and macOS, the live tier headless and windowed (under Xvfb) (implements [ci.md](../specs/ci.md)) | In progress |
