# Fast tier shared fixtures.
#
# If the package has process-global or singleton state (a module-level registry,
# a cached client, a configured logger), add an `autouse=True` fixture here that
# resets it before and after each test so state can't leak between tests. Keep
# this tier deterministic and network-free — anything that hits a real service
# belongs in tests-e2e/ instead.
